Hi! I'm an open source maintainer working for the NeuroPoly research lab at Polytechnique Montreal. ðŸ‘‹

For the [past 4 years](https://github.com/spinalcordtoolbox/spinalcordtoolbox/graphs/contributors), I've maintained the [**Spinal Cord Toolbox**](https://spinalcordtoolbox.com/index.html), a [highly-regarded](https://spinalcordtoolbox.com/overview/testimonials.html) Python-based software package in a niche, data-driven research field. Our user base is small but meaningful; we serve the needs of medical researchers by providing them with [a wealth of spinal cord image processing tools](https://spinalcordtoolbox.com/user_section/tutorials.html), with our work serving as the backbone for [countless vital clinical studies](https://spinalcordtoolbox.com/overview/studies.html) published in many high-impact journals.
