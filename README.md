Hi! I'm an open source maintainer working for the NeuroPoly research lab at Polytechnique Montreal. For the past 2 years, I've maintained the Spinal Cord Toolbox, a highly-regarded Python package in a niche, data-driven research field. Our user base is small but meaningful; we serve the needs of medical researchers by providing them with a wealth of spinal cord image processing tools. Our work has served as the backbone for countless vital clinical studies published in many high-impact journals.
